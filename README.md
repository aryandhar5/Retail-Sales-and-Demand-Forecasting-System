## **Project Title: Retail Sales Data Analysis and Prediction**

## Problem Statement

The retail industry is a highly competitive sector where businesses need to optimize their operations, marketing strategies, and inventory management to stay ahead. A major factor influencing retail success is the accurate prediction of sales, which can help in better decision-making, inventory management, and customer targeting.

This project aims to analyze a retail sales dataset and build a machine learning model to predict the total sales for each transaction based on various factors, such as the product category, customer demographics (age, gender), quantity sold, and price per unit. The goal is to provide insights into the factors that drive sales and develop a predictive model that can help businesses forecast future sales with high accuracy.

Overall Information

---> In this project, we will work with a retail sales dataset that includes the following columns:

## 1) Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).

## 2) Product Category: The type of product purchased (e.g., Beauty, Clothing, Electronics).

## 3) Age: The age of the customer.

## 4) Quantity: The quantity of products purchased.

## 5) Price per Unit: The price of a single unit of the product.

## 6) Total_Sales: The total sales amount for the transaction.

--> The analysis will focus on exploring relationships between the features (independent variables) and the target variable (Total_Sales). We will also use machine learning algorithms to predict sales and evaluate the performance of various models, including Ridge and Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Objectives
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Explore the data to check for missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables. Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.

Visualization: Create visualizations to understand sales trends, product category performance, and demographic breakdowns (e.g., gender-based sales comparison).

Feature Engineering: Create new features like age segments or any other derived variable that could improve the model's prediction capabilities.

Modeling: Build and evaluate different machine learning models, such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict sales and assess which model performs the best.

Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like cross-validation and grid search to tune hyperparameters and improve model performance.
