# Retail Sales Prediction & Analysis

## Project Overview

- The retail industry is highly competitive, requiring businesses to optimize operations, enhance marketing strategies, and improve inventory management. A key factor in driving retail success is the ability to accurately predict sales, enabling better decision-making and customer targeting.

- This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to identify key drivers of revenue and develop a machine learning model for predicting total sales per transaction. Additionally, an interactive Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights, helping businesses understand sales patterns and customer behavior.

## Objectives

- Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables. Ensure data is clean and structured for modeling.

- Feature Engineering: Develop meaningful features, such as customer segmentation and seasonality trends, to enhance predictive accuracy.

- Machine Learning Modeling: Implement and compare various regression models, including Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to determine the best-performing model for sales prediction.

- Hyperparameter Tuning & Validation: Optimize models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

- Power BI Dashboard: Create an interactive dashboard for visualizing key business metrics, including revenue trends, product category performance, and customer demographics.

## Dataset Description

- The dataset includes key attributes relevant to retail sales analysis:

- Gender: Male or Female customers.

- Product Category: Categories such as Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty.

- Age: Age of the customer.

- Quantity: Number of items purchased in a transaction.

- Price per Unit: Cost of a single unit of the product.

- Total Sales: Total revenue generated per transaction.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis & Cleaning:
